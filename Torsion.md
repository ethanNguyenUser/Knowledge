## $\displaystyle \theta=\frac{\tau L}{GJ}$
* $\displaystyle \theta$ is the angle of twist on one end of a uniaxial rod fixed at the other end
* $\displaystyle \tau$ is the [[torque]] applied to the rod
* $\displaystyle L$ is the length of the rod
* $\displaystyle G$ is the [[shear modulus]]
* $\displaystyle J$ is the [[Polar Moment of Intertia]]
