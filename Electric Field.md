* Electric field of line charge
* $\displaystyle \lambda$ is the linear charge density

* Electric field of volume charge
* $\displaystyle \rho$ is the volume charge density
* $\displaystyle \tau$ is an infinitesimal volume element
## $\displaystyle \nabla \times \vec{E}=0$
* This states that the curl of an electric field is 0 when considering only charges and not magnetic fields
