		- $n \propto \frac{1}{\lambda}$
			For most materials, this is the case
			For many materials, the amount of refraction depends on the wavelength of light. If this is true, this dependence is called dispersion
		- $I=I_\text{max}\cos^2(\phi),\space I_\text{max}=\frac{I_0}{2}$
			Malus’s Law
			The intensity through a second polarizer depends on the  angle $\phi$ between the two polarizers’ axes 
		- $\tan(\theta_p)=\frac{n_b}{n_a}$
			Brewster’s Law
			The angle of incident light at which none of the reflected light has light polarized in the parallel to the plane of incidence
			A consequence of this law is that the reflected and refracted ray are perpendicular to eachother
			$\theta_p$ is the angle between the polarized light and the 
		- $I_\text{rayleigh scattered}\propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4}$
			The intensity of scatttered light due to Rayleigh scattering is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength of light. So blue light for example scatters much more than red light
