Refers to the idea that protons attached to aromatic rings are more deshielded than expected. This occurs because $\displaystyle \vec{B}$ is induced in the same direction as the incident $\displaystyle \vec{B}_{0}$. The $\displaystyle \vec{B}$ occurs like below

In this diagram, the current is [[conventional current]]. When the aromatic compound is first placed in the magnetic field, [[magnetic flux]] increases, which then kick starts the electrons in a counter clockwise flow in this diagram. Due to the [[Lorentz force]], the electrons continue circulating and thus producing the magnetic field which contributes to
