## $\text{im}(T)=\{T(\vec x):\vec x\in \mathbb{R}^m\}=\text{span}(\vec v_1,\ldots,\vec v_m)$
* $T:\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^n$
* Same as the range of a function
* $\text{im}(T)\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\text{im(T)}$ is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$
* Also known as the column space of $A$, where $A$ is a matrix of column vectors representing $T$
