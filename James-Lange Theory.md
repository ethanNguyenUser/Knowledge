Theory of motivation where stimulus->(1st Response) nervous system arousal->(2nd Response) conscious emotion
Proven false by spinal cord injury patients: they are unable to have a physiological response (e.g. sweaty palms) but still report having emotions
## Mnemonic
* James Bond is a trained, cold-blooded secret agent that acts before even needing to think, having his nervous system act first before recognizing emotion
