## $\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$
* Called the Lorentzâ€™s factor
* Is a ubiquitous factor for equations in special relativity like for time dilation
* $v$ is the magnitude of the velocity that a reference frame $S'$ is moving relative to $S$
* When $v\ll c$, $\gamma\approx 1$
* As $v\rightarrow c^{-}$, $\gamma$ increases significantly beyond $1$
