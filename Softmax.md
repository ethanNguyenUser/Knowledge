## $\displaystyle P(Y=i|X)= \frac{e^{\beta_{0,i}+\beta_{1,i}X}}{\sum_{j=1}^{K}e^{{\beta}_{0,j}+\beta_{1,j}X}}$
*  Probability that our prediction $\displaystyle Y$ is of a class $\displaystyle i$ given some data $\displaystyle X$ when there are $\displaystyle K$ classes
* Has the effect of setting one term close to 1 and the others close to 0
* The denominator is a normalization term to make this a valid probability
