## $\displaystyle R^{2}=1- \frac{\sum_{i}(\hat{y}_{i}-y_{i})^{2}}{\sum_{i}(\bar{y}-y_{i})^{2}}$
* $\displaystyle \hat{y}_{i}$ is the predicted value of $\displaystyle y$ due to a point $\displaystyle x_{i}$
* The numerator term is the sum of squares of residuals, or a sort of error of the model
* The denominator term is the total sum of squares, or a sort of error of the average
* The denominator
* Ranges from $\displaystyle 0$ to $\displaystyle 1$
	* $\displaystyle R^{2}=1$ means total correlation between our predictor variable and our response variable
