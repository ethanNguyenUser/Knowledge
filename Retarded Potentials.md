Potentials for moving charges or currents (information doesn't travel instantaneously, so we use [[retarded time]])
## Topics
* [[Jefimenko's Equations]]
* [[Lienard-Wiechert Potentials]]
## $\displaystyle V(\vec{r},t)=k\int \frac{\rho(\vec{r}',t_{r})}{\mathscr{r}} \, \mathrm{d}\tau'$
* $\displaystyle t_{r}$ is the [[retarded time]]
## $\displaystyle \vec{A}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{{\mu}_{0}}{4\pi}\int  \frac{\vec{J}(\vec{r}',t_{r})}{\mathscr{r}} \, \mathrm{d}\tau'$
