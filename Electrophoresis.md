## $\displaystyle v=\frac{Ez}{f}$
* $\displaystyle v$ is the migrational velocity of the protein in the medium
* $\displaystyle E$ is the electric field strength
* $\displaystyle z$ is the net charge on the protein
* $\displaystyle f$ is the frictional coefficient on the protein, which is typically dependent on the mass and shape of the molecule
* Can be derived by $\displaystyle \sum F=zE-fv=ma=0$ due to $\displaystyle a\rightarrow0$ at terminal velocity (check this later...)
