Essentially states that people tend to observe negative correlations in a subpopulation high in both characteristics between two possibly unrelated or even positively correlated variables
## Examples
* Attractiveness and Talent
	* Celebrities seem either talented or attractive, which may lead one to conclude that attractiveness and talent are inversely correlated. However, those who are neither talented nor attractive likely wouldn't become celebrities. In fact, the two variables are unrelated
