## $\displaystyle \Phi_{B}=\vec{B}\cdot \vec{A}=BA\cos \theta$
* $\displaystyle \vec{B}$ is the [[magnetic field]] passing through a surface
* $\displaystyle \vec{A}$ is a vector of the same magnitude as the surface's area and normal to the surface
* $\displaystyle \theta$ is the angle between $\displaystyle \vec{B}$ and $\displaystyle \vec{A}$
