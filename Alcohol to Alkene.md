## Reagents
$\displaystyle \ce{HA + \Delta}$
## Mechanism: [[E1]]
1. $\displaystyle \ce{HA}$ protonates $\displaystyle \ce{-OH}$ group to become $\displaystyle \ce{-OH_{2}+}$
2. $\displaystyle \ce{OH_{2}+}$ group leaves
3. Rearrangements may happen
4. $\displaystyle \beta$ carbon's hydrogen gets picked off by an $\displaystyle \ce{A-}$, sending electrons from the C-H bond to create a C=C between the $\displaystyle \beta$ and $\displaystyle \alpha$ carbons, causing the $\displaystyle \ce{OH_{2}+}$ group to leave, creating an alkene
