## $\displaystyle P_{\text{in}}=P_{\text{out}}$
* The pressure going into a closed system is equal to the pressure exerted on another part of the closed system
* i.e. pressure is constant throughout the closed system
* Used to solve hydraulics problems
## $\displaystyle F_{\text{out}}=\frac{A_{\text{out}}}{A_{\text{in}}}F_{\text{in}}$
* Expanded form used for hydraulics
