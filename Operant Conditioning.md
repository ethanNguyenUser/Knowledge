## Types
* Positive Reinforcement
	* Adding a stimulus to reinforce a behavior
	* E.g.: Giving money whenever a person smiles reinforce the person's behavior of smiling
* Negative Reinforcement
	* Removing a stimulus to reinforce a behavior
	* E.g.: Stopping electric shocks to a person for when they smile may allow them to smile more
* Positive Punishment
	* Adding a stimulus to punish behavior
	* E.g.: Administering electric shocks to a person whenever they smile will prevent them from smiling (although not necessarily due to operant conditioning, they might be a bit "shocked" rather than happy)
* Negative Punishment
	* Removing a stimulus to punish a behavior
	* E.g.: Removing air from the surrounding area whenever a person smiles may prevent the person from smiling (and possibly breathing too)
