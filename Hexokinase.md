#Biochemistry 
## Types
* Hexokinase (II)
	* For all body tissues
	* Inhibited by [[Glucose-6-Phosphate]]
* Glucokinase (IV)
	* Predominates in liver (so it's more prone to not doing glycolysis for low blood sugars, meaning $\displaystyle K_{m}$ is higher, or that binding affinity to glucose is a lot lower than hexokinase)
		* The $\displaystyle K_{m}$ is the same as the homeostasis physiological [[blood sugar levels]]
	* Not inhibited by [[Glucose-6-Phosphate]]
