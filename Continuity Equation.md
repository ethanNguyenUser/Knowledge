## $\displaystyle Q=Av$
* $\displaystyle Q$ is volumetric flow rate (this is conserved)
* $\displaystyle A$ is cross sectional area of the pipe
* $\displaystyle v$ is the linear flow velocity
## $\displaystyle \frac{ \partial \rho }{ \partial t }+\nabla\cdot j=\sigma$
* $\displaystyle \rho$ is the fluid density
* $\displaystyle j$ is the flux of the fluid
* $\displaystyle \sigma$ is the amount of fluid generated
## $\displaystyle \frac{ \partial P }{ \partial t }+\nabla\cdot J=0$
* Quantum Mechanics edition
* $\displaystyle P$ is the probability density function of a particle
* $\displaystyle J$ is the probability current, or how much of a particle is flowing 
## $\displaystyle \frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \vec{J}$
* $\displaystyle J$ is the current (e.g. $\displaystyle \frac{\mathrm{d}Q }{ \mathrm{d}t}$) of a quantity
* $\displaystyle \rho$ is the quantity density (e..g charge density) per unit volume
* Can be interpreted as saying that the tim`e rate of change in a quantity is equal to the negative of the amount leaving it
* Can be derived by [[divergence theorem]]
