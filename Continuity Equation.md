## $\displaystyle Q=Av$
* $\displaystyle Q$ is volumetric flow rate (this is conserved)
* $\displaystyle A$ is cross sectional area of the pipe
* $\displaystyle v$ is the linear flow velocity
## $\displaystyle \frac{ \partial \rho }{ \partial t }+\nabla\cdot j=\sigma$
* [[Fluid mechanics]] version
* $\displaystyle \rho$ is the fluid density
* $\displaystyle j$ is the flux of the fluid
* $\displaystyle \sigma$ is the amount of fluid generated
## $\displaystyle \frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \vec{J}=0$
* [[Electromagnetism]] version
* $\displaystyle J$ is the [[current]] (e.g. $\displaystyle \frac{\mathrm{d}Q }{ \mathrm{d}t}$) of a quantity
* $\displaystyle \rho$ is the quantity density (e..g charge density) per unit volume
* Can be interpreted as saying that the time rate of change in a quantity is equal to the negative of the amount leaving it
* Can be derived by [[divergence theorem]]
* Can also be derived by taking the divergence of [[Ampere's law]] and applying [[Gauss's law]] to $\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \vec{E}$
## $\displaystyle \frac{\partial u }{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \vec{S}=0$
* [[Conservation of Energy]] version
* $\displaystyle u$ is [[electromagnetic field energy density]]
* $\displaystyle \vec{S}$ is the [[Poynting vector]]
## $\displaystyle \frac{\partial \vec{g} }{\partial t}+\nabla \cdot \stackrel{\Rightarrow}{T}=0$
* [[Conservation of Momentum]] version
* $\displaystyle \vec{g}$ is the [[momentum density]]
* $\displaystyle \stackrel{\Rightarrow}{T}$ is the [[Maxwell's stress tensor]]
## $\displaystyle \frac{ \partial P }{ \partial t }+\nabla\cdot J=0$
* [[Quantum mechanics]] version
* $\displaystyle P$ is the probability density function of a particle
* $\displaystyle J$ is the probability current, or how much of a particle is flowing
