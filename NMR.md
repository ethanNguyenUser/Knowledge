## [Video Visualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZLew6Ff-JE)
NMR places [[paramagnetic]] isotopes in a magnetic field $\displaystyle B_{0}$. Radio waves of frequency $\displaystyle \nu_{r}$ are shot at the isotopes, causing them to [[Precession|precess]]. The precession induces a current in coils surrounding the atoms arranged as shown in the video. $\displaystyle \nu$ is then extracted from this, and depending on the species present, there is a certain shift in $\displaystyle \nu$ in ppm relative to irradiating frequency $\displaystyle v_{r}$
## Common Isotopes Used
* $\displaystyle \ce{{}^{1}H}$
* $\displaystyle \ce{^{13}C}$
## $\displaystyle \nu=\frac{\gamma B_{0}}{2\pi}$
* $\displaystyle \nu$ is the [[precession]] frequency of the isotope
* $\displaystyle \gamma$ is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the isotope
* $\displaystyle B_{0}$ is the magnetic field
# Interpretation of $\displaystyle \ce{^{1}H}$ NMR
## Integration
* The area under a the curve by a signal corresponds proportionally to the number of hydrogens for that signal
## Peaks vs Signals
* Each group of equivalent hydrogens produce exactly one signal
* These signals can be composed of 1, 2, 3, 4, or multiple peaks. We then may say a signal is split into/has a multiplicity of a singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, or multiplet
## Chemical Shifting
* A greater chemical shift in [[NMR]] means a lower $\displaystyle \nu$ relative to that of [[TMS]]
* Downfield (deshielded or more polar) molecules have greater chemical shift
* Upfield (shielded or more nonpolar) molecules have less chemical shift

## Signal Splitting
* $\displaystyle (n+1)$ rule
	* $\displaystyle \ce{^{1}H}$ NMR signal is split into $\displaystyle n+1$ peaks, where $\displaystyle n$ is the number of non-equivalent hydrogen neighbors
	* Only applicable if the hydrogen neighbors are the same or similar in coupling to each other
* Coupling Constant $\displaystyle (J)$
	* Describes the separation between two peaks in a signal
* [[Vicinal]] Splitting
	* Caused by hydrogens [[vicinal]] to each other
	* Follows [[Karplus Equation]]
* [[Geminal]] Splitting
	* Caused by hydrogens [[geminal]] to each other
	* Splitting is much smaller than that caused by [[vicinal]] splitting
* Benzene Protons
	* Can couple only with each other to produce multiplets
* $\displaystyle \ce{-OH}$ and $\displaystyle \ce{-NH}$ show up only as singlets
