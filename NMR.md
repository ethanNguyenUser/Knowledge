NMR places [[paramagnetic]] isotopes in a magnetic field $\displaystyle B_{0}$. Radio waves of frequency $\displaystyle \nu_{r}$ are shot at the isotopes, causing them to [[Precession|precess]]. The precession induces a current in coils surrounding the atoms arranged as shown in the video. $\displaystyle \nu$ is then extracted from this, and depending on the species present, there is a certain shift in $\displaystyle \nu$ in ppm relative to irradiating frequency $\displaystyle v_{r}$
## Common Isotopes Used
* $\displaystyle \ce{{}^{1}H}$
* $\displaystyle \ce{^{13}C}$
## $\displaystyle \nu=\frac{\gamma B_{0}}{2\pi}$
* $\displaystyle \nu$ is the [[precession]] frequency of the isotope
* $\displaystyle \gamma$ is the [[gyromagnetic ratio]] of the isotope
* $\displaystyle B_{0}$ is the magnetic field
