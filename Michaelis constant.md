## $\displaystyle K_{m}=\frac{k_{-1}+k_{2}}{k_{1}}$
* Parameter in the [[Michaelis-Menten equation]] that correlates with how quickly an enzyme reaches $\displaystyle v_{\text{max}}$ when increasing $\displaystyle [S]$. Lower $\displaystyle K_{m}$ means higher enzyme binding affinity for the substrate
* $\displaystyle k_{-1}+k_{2}$ corresponds to the efflux of ES into E + S and E + P whereas $\displaystyle k_{1}$ corresponds to the influx from E + S to form ES
* $\displaystyle k_{-1}$ is the rate constant in the backward direction of the E + S to ES reaction. It measures the ES to E + S reaction rate
* $\displaystyle k_{2}$ is the rate constant in the forward direction going from ES to E + P
* $\displaystyle k_{1}$ is the rate constant in the forward direction going from E + S to ES
