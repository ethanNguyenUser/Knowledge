## $\displaystyle \nabla ^{2} V=-\frac{\rho}{{\varepsilon}_{0}}$
* The [[laplacian]] of the voltage
* Given by the definition of [[voltage]] and the differential form of [[Gauss's law]]
* The case where the RHS is 0 is called [[Laplace's equation]]
## $\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}V+\partial_{t}(\nabla \cdot \vec{A})=-\frac{\rho}{{\varepsilon}_{0}}$
* Time-dependent version
