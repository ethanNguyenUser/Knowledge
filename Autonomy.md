Kant's definition of autonomy meant the capability to make decisions out of one's own rational agency rather than out of simply following their desires or due to external factors

The typical definition requires:
1. Understanding of what you're doing
2. An intention of doing it
3. No external or internal influence
	1. E.g. coercion or mental illness
