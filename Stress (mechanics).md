## Topics
* [[Shear Stress]]
* [[Mohr's Circle]]
## $\displaystyle \sigma=\frac{F}{A}=E\varepsilon$
* Different from [[pressure]] in that the forces are internal to the object
* $\displaystyle F$ is the axial force
* $\displaystyle E$ is [[Young's Modulus]]
* $\displaystyle \varepsilon$ is [[strain]]
