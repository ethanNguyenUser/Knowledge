Tells how much a material streteches/deforms laterally relative to the [[Force|load]]
## $\displaystyle \nu=-\frac{\mathrm{d}\varepsilon _{\text{trans}} }{ \mathrm{d}\varepsilon _{\text{axial}}}$
* $\displaystyle \varepsilon _{\text{trans}}$ is the [[strain]] in the direction perpendicular to the load
* $\displaystyle \varepsilon _{\text{axial}}$ is the strain in the direction along the axis of the load
* More brittle materials generally have lower Poisson ratios while more elastic materials have higher Poisson ratios
