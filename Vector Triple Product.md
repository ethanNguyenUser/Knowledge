#Math 
## $\displaystyle \vec{a}\times(\vec{b}\times \vec{c})=\vec{b}(\vec{a}\cdot \vec{c})-\vec{c}(\vec{a}\cdot \vec{b})$
## Mnemonic
* BAC-CAB
* First vector in parenthesis scaled by dot product of other two vectors - second vector in parenthesis scales by a dot product of other two vectors
	* i.e. The value of a triple vector product is a linear combination of two vectors in the parenthesis; the coefficient of each vector is the dot product of the other two; the middle vector in the triple product always has the positive sign
