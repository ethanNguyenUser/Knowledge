## $\displaystyle \text{Catalytic Efficiency}=\frac{k_{\text{cat}}}{K_{m}}$
* This is the rate that ES becomes EP regardless of the concentration of substrate
* This value times $\displaystyle [E]$ is the slope of the line [[Michaelis-Menten equation]] when $\displaystyle [S]\ll K_{m}$
* $\displaystyle k_{\text{cat}}$ is the [[turnover number]]
* $\displaystyle K_{m}$ is the [[Michaelis Constant]]
