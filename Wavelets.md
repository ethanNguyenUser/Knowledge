Allows you to produce spectrograms by corresponding the intensity of a certain frequency at a certain time to the magnitude of the complex [[convolution]] of a small wavelet curve on the sample of interest.
## $\displaystyle T(a,b)= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y(t)\Psi\left( \frac{t-b}{a} \right) \, \mathrm{d}t$
* $\displaystyle T(a,b)$ is the intensity of the wave at a time $\displaystyle b$ and scaling (opposite of frequency) $\displaystyle a$ and is found as the convolution of the sample and wavelet
* $\displaystyle y(t)$ is the sample
* $\displaystyle \Psi$ is the wavelet and may be 
* $\displaystyle t$ is time
* $\displaystyle b$ is the
