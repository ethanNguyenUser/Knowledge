## Bonds
### Single bond
```
CCCC
```
```smiles
CCCC
```
### Double bond
```
CCC=C
```
```smiles
CCC=C
```
### Triple bond
```
CCC#C
```
```smiles
CCC#C
```
**Note**: for some reason,
```
CC#C
```
renders as
```smiles
CC#C
```
when it should look more like -<ins>=</ins>
### Aromatic bond
```
c1ccccc1
```
```smiles
c1ccccc1
```
