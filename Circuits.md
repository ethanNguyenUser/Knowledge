## $\displaystyle V=\varepsilon-IR_{\text{int}}$
* $\displaystyle V$ is the voltage the battery actually supplies to the circuit
* $\displaystyle \varepsilon$ is the electromotive force the battery theoretically can provide
* $\displaystyle IR_{\text{int}}$ is voltage used up on the resistive components of the battery, where $\displaystyle R_{\text{int}}$ is the internal resistance
