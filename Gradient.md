#Math 
## $\displaystyle \nabla f:\text{scalar}\rightarrow \text{vector}$
* Can be thought of as the vector pointing to the direction which would lead to fastest ascent/increase of $\displaystyle f$
* $\displaystyle \lvert \nabla f\rvert$  is the magnitude of the slope along the direction of fastest ascent
* $\displaystyle \nabla$ is the [[del]] operator
## $\displaystyle f(x,y)_{\perp}=\nabla (f(x,y)-z)$
* The normal vector to a multivariable function which may represent a surface can be found by taking the gradient of (the function - an extra dimensional variable)

# Properties
## $\displaystyle \nabla(kf)=k\nabla f$
* $\displaystyle k$ is a scalar
* $\displaystyle f$ is a function
## $\displaystyle \nabla(fg)=f\nabla g+g\nabla f$
