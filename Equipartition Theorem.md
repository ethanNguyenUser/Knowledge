Essentially states that the thermal energy of a particle is split equally between different kinetic energies such as the three translational energies, rotational energies, and vibrational energies
## $\displaystyle K=\frac{3}{2}k_{B}T$
* $\displaystyle K$ is the kinetic energy of the particle
* $\displaystyle k_{B}$ is the [[Boltzmann Constant]]
* $\displaystyle T$ is temperature
