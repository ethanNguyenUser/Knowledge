###### My idea is that you get to know people better by observing them under varying conditions. You can vary the environment under many dimensions such as:
1. Familiarity (are they in a familiar environment or one totally new?)
2. Amount of people (are they alone, 1-on-1, or say in a large group?)
3. State of mind (are they down in the dumps or feeling quite jubilant?)
4. Stress (are they swamped with many stressors or are they totally free?)
