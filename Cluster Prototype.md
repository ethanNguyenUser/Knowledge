## $\displaystyle \mu_{k}= \frac{\sum_{n = 1}^{N} r_{nk} x_{n}}{\sum_{n = 1}^{N} r_{nk}}$
* $\displaystyle \mu_{k}$ is the prototype of cluster $\displaystyle k$, or where we initially guess the location of our cluster and iteratively improve upon. Is also the [[Mean|average]] of the points assigned to cluster $\displaystyle k$
* The denominator denotes the number of points in cluster $\displaystyle k$
