## $\displaystyle \mathrm{MAP=DP+\frac{SP-DP}{3}}$
* $\displaystyle \text{DP}$ is the [[diastolic pressure]]
* $\displaystyle \text{SP}$ is the [[systolic blood pressure]]
* The formula isn't $\displaystyle \mathrm{\frac{SP+DP}{2}}$ because a typical cardiac cycle spends about $\displaystyle \frac{1}{3}$ of its time in diastole vs. $\displaystyle \frac{2}{d}$ of its time in systole
