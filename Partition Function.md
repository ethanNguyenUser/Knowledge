## $\displaystyle Z=\sum_{s}e^{- \beta\varepsilon_{s}}$
* Probability normalization factor (the below equation has to sum up to one when evaluating over all energies
* We sum over all microstates with index $\displaystyle s$
* $\displaystyle \varepsilon_{s}$ is the energy of a particular microstate
* $\displaystyle e^{- \beta\varepsilon}$ is the [[Boltzmann Factor]]
* $\displaystyle \beta$ is the [[coldness]] of the system
## $\displaystyle Z_{1}=Vn_{Q}$
* This is the partition function for one particle that can take two states
* $\displaystyle n_{Q}$ is the [[quantum concentration]]
* $\displaystyle V$ is the volume of the gas
## $\displaystyle Z_{N}=\frac{Z_{1}^{N}}{N!}$
* Partition function for $\displaystyle N$ particles in an ideal gas
* $\displaystyle Z_{1}$ is the partition function for one particle that can take two states
