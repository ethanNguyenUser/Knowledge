#Physics 
## $\displaystyle P_{1}+\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{1}^{2}+\rho gh_{1}=P_{2}+\frac{1}{2}\rho v_{2}^{2}+\rho gh_{2}$
* Essentially states that faster flowing fluids experience lower pressure
* Only for low viscosity/laminar flow systems where conservation of energy applies
* $\displaystyle P$ is the absolute pressure of the fluid
* $\displaystyle \rho$ is the fluid density
* $\displaystyle v$ is the fluid velocity
* $\displaystyle g$ is the [[gravitational acceleration constant]]
* $\displaystyle h$ is the fluid height above some reference point
* $\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}$ is the [[dynamic pressure]] of the fluid
* $\displaystyle P+\rho gh$ is the [[static pressure]] or gauge pressure of the fluid
# Applications
* [[Pitot Tubes]]
* [[Venturi Flow Meter]]
* [[Airfoils]]
	* Airplane wing lift
	* Automotive wing
		* Increases downforce for more normal force/traction
* Spoiler
	* Disrupts airflow over the top of the car to prevent lift from being generated by fast airflow over the top of the car and slow airflow at the bottom
* Drafting
	* Cars get sucked together due to airflow being faster between them (less area to travel through, which is the application of the continuity equation), so a lower static pressure is created between the cars
