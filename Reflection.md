When a wave meets an interface between two mediums of different wave travel speed, reflection of the wave occurs
## Topics
* [[Reflection Coefficient]]
* [[Fresnel's Equation]]
## $\theta_R=\theta_I$
* The angle between the reflected light ray and the normal of the surface is equal to the angle between the incident light ray and the normal of the surface
## $\displaystyle E_{0_{R}}=\left\lvert  \frac{v_{2}-v_{1}}{v_{2}+v_{1}} \right\rvert E_{0_{I}}=\left\lvert  \frac{n_{1}-n_{2}}{n_{1}+n_{2}} \right\rvert E_{0_{I}}$
* Reflected wave amplitude
* $\displaystyle E_{0_{I}}$ is the incident wave amplitude
* $\displaystyle v_{1}$ and $\displaystyle v_{2}$ are the wave velocities in medium 1 (from incident wave) and medium 2 (where the incident wave is heading toward)
* $\displaystyle n_{1}$ and $\displaystyle n_{2}$ are [[refraction]] indices
## $\displaystyle \delta_{R}=\pi(v_{1}>v_{2})+\delta_{I}$
* Phase difference in reflected wave compared to incident wave is $\displaystyle \pi$ if the waves travel quicker in the first medium compared to the second, 0 otherwise
* I.e. the reflected wave will be upside down relative to the incident wave if waves travel quicker in the first medium
