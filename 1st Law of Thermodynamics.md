# Closed System
Thermodynamic postulation of [[Conservation of Energy]]
## $\displaystyle \Delta U=Q-W$
* $\displaystyle \Delta U$ is the change in potential energy of the system
* $\displaystyle Q$ is the heat gained by the system
* $\displaystyle W$ is the work done by the system
## Processes
* Isothermal $\displaystyle \Delta U=0\rightarrow Q=W$
* Adiabatic $\displaystyle Q=0\rightarrow \Delta U=-W$
* Isobaric $\displaystyle \Delta P=0$
* Isochoric $\displaystyle \Delta V=0\rightarrow W=0\rightarrow \Delta U=Q$
# Isolated System
* $\displaystyle \Delta U=0\rightarrow U_{0}=U_{f}$
