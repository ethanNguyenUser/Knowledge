A common example is the conditioning by Pavlov of his dog to salivate at the ringing of a bell. Works primarily for subconscious processes rather than more complex ones. So one who may desire to enter a flow state for studying or in sports may try to associate a certain constant in their environment with the flow state. For instance, a student may chew a specific flavor of gum and sit in a certain chair to get into a "study" mode
## Stimuli and Responses
2. Unconditioned Stimulus: Meat
3. Unconditioned Response: Salivation
4. Conditioned Stimulus (originally a neutral stimulus): Bell
5. Conditioned Response: Salivation (at ringing of bell)
## Extinction
Refers to when a stimulus no longer elicits a conditioned response. May undergo what's called spontaneous recovery, which is when the stimulus produces a weak response after some time when the extinct stimulus was repeatedly shown
