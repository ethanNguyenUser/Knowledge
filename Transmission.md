* [[Transmission Coefficient]]
* [[Fresnel's Equation]]
## $\displaystyle E_{0_{T}}=\left( \frac{2v_{2}}{v_{2}+v_{1}} \right)E_{0_{I}}=\left( \frac{2n_{1}}{n_{1}+n_{2}} \right)E_{0_{I}}$
* Transmitted wave amplitude
* $\displaystyle E_{0_{I}}$ is the incident wave amplitude
## $\displaystyle \delta_{T}=\delta_{I}$
* Transmitted wave phase difference is the same as the incident wave's phase difference
