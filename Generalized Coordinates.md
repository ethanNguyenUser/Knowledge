#Physics 
When dealing with Lagrangian/Hamiltonian mechanics, coordinates can have units of length, angles, energy, etc.
## Notation
* $\displaystyle q_{1},q_{2},q_{3},\ldots\rightarrow q_{j}$
## $\displaystyle s=3n-m$
* $\displaystyle s$ is the degrees of freedom of the system
* $\displaystyle n$ is the number of radius vectors
* $\displaystyle m$ is the number of equations of constraint
