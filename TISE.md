## $\displaystyle \hat{H}\psi=E\psi$
* Obtained by applying [[separation of variables]] on the [[TISE]]
* Also derivable by [[wave equation]]
* $\displaystyle \psi$ is $\displaystyle \psi(\vec{r})$ and is an [[eigenfunction]] of the TISE
* $\displaystyle \vec{r}$ is the [[position vector]] that is the same as $\displaystyle {\left\langle{x,y,z}\right\rangle}$ in $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{3}$
* $\displaystyle E$ is discrete
