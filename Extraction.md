#Chemistry 
The process of extracting a compound from a mix of compounds by exploiting the compound's greater solubility in one liquid as opposed to another one
## Topics
* [[Partition Coefficient]]
## $\displaystyle W_{1(n)}=W_{i}\left( \frac{V_{1}}{KV_{2}+V_{1}} \right)^{n}$
* $\displaystyle W_{1(n)}$ is the amount of compound in solvent 1 after $\displaystyle n$ extractions
* $\displaystyle n$ is the number of extractions
* $\displaystyle W_{i}$ is the initial amount of substance in the entire solution
* $\displaystyle V_{1}$ is the volume of solvent 1
* $\displaystyle V_{2}$ is the volume of solvent 2
* $\displaystyle K$ is the partition coefficient of the compound of interest for $\displaystyle \frac{\text{solvent 2}}{\text{solvent 1}}$
