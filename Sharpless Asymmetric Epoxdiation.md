#Chemistry
Used to produce an epoxide of certain stereochemistry
```smiles
OCC([1*])=C([2*])[3*]
```
becomes with addition of (+)-DET $\displaystyle \ce{tBuOOH}$ and $\displaystyle \ce{Ti(O-iPr)4}$
```smiles
OC[C@]1([1*])O[C@@]1([2*])[3*]
```
where the epoxide oxygen is meant to stick into the screen
## Mnemonic
Left hand rule
Thumb = $\displaystyle \ce{-CH_{2}OH}$
Four fingers = alkene
Negative (-) = kNuckle
Positive (+) = Palm

This mnemonic was developed by Professor Hung Pham in grad school.
