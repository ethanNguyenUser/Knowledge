## $\displaystyle K_{I}=\frac{[I]}{\left( \frac{K_{M}^{\text{app}}(1+[I]/\alpha K_{I})}{K_{M}}-1 \right)}$
* $\displaystyle K_{M}$ is the 
* $\displaystyle K_{M}^{\text{app}}$ is the apparent $\displaystyle K_{M}$ after inhibitor is added
* $\displaystyle [I]$ is the concentration of inhibitor
* $\displaystyle \alpha$ is how differently the enzyme binds to the enzyme substrate
