When inhibitors bind [[Allosteric Regulation|allosterically]] to the ES complex to form an ESI complex

* $\displaystyle K_{m}$ decreased
	* It's easier to reach half $\displaystyle v_{\text{max}}$ because the inhibitor causes ES to stay stuck together
* $\displaystyle v_{\text{max}}$ decreased
	* Inhibitor is converting all ES to inactivated form, so there's a cap added to $\displaystyle v_{\text{max}}$

## Mnemonic
* The U looks like two arrows pointing downward, indicating decreasing $\displaystyle K_{m}$ and $\displaystyle v_{\text{max}}$
* The U is horizontally symmetrical, so this corresponds to the inhibitor only binding the ES complex
