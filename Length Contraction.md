## $l=\frac{l_0}{\gamma}$
* This equation describes the length contraction of an object that is stationary in $S'$ as observed by someone in reference frame $S$
* $l_0$ is called the proper length of the object and is measured in $S'$.
* $l$ is the length measured of the object in $S$
* The length measured has to be parallel to the movement between $S$and $S'$
