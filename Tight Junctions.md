#Biology 
Forms a diffusion barrier (prevents membrane proteins from migrating from the apical to basal side and vice versa) and permeability barrier (prevents molecules in the lumen from reaching the ECM and vice versa)
## Components
* Occludins
* Claudins
* ZO Proteins
* Actin skeleton (connected to actin skeleton generally)
