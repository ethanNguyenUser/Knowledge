The potentials for a point charge $\displaystyle q$ moving at velocity $\displaystyle \vec{v}$. All values like $\displaystyle \mathscr{r}$, $\displaystyle \vec{u}$, $\displaystyle v$, and $\displaystyle \vec{a}$ are evaluated at [[retarded time]]
## Topics
* [[Constant Velocity Lienard-Wiechert Potentials]]
## $\displaystyle V(\vec{r},t)=k \frac{qc}{(\mathscr{r}c-\vec{\mathscr{r}}\cdot \vec{v})}$
* $\displaystyle \mathscr{\vec{r}}$  is the [[separation vector]] for the charge at its retarded position to the field point $\displaystyle \vec{r}$
## $\displaystyle \vec{A}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{\vec{v}}{c^{2}}V(\vec{r},t)$
## $\displaystyle \mathscr{\vec{r}}=\vec{r}-\vec{w}(t_{r}),\lVert \mathscr{\vec{r}}\rVert=c(t-t_{r})$
* The [[separation vector]] for moving charges, or the difference between the field point and where the charge once was
* $\displaystyle \vec{r}$ is the [[position vector]]
* $\displaystyle \vec{w}(t)$ is the position of the point charge at time $\displaystyle t$
* $\displaystyle t_{r}$ is the [[retarded time]]
* Use this equation to solve for $\displaystyle t_{r}$ and then plug it into the above equations
## $\displaystyle \vec{E}(\vec{r},t)=k \frac{q \mathscr{r}}{(\mathscr{\vec{r}}\cdot \vec{u})^{3}}[(c^{2}-v^{2})\vec{u}+\mathscr{\vec{r}}\times (\vec{u}\times \vec{a})]$
* The first term reduces to [[coloumb's law]] when there is minimal velocity and acceleration
* The second term is the [[radiation field]]
* $\displaystyle \vec{a}$ is the time rate of change of velocity $\displaystyle v$
* $\displaystyle \vec{u}=c\mathscr{\hat{r}}-\vec{v}$
## $\displaystyle \vec{B}(\vec{r},t)=\frac{1}{c}\mathscr{\hat{r}}\times \vec{E}(\vec{r},t)$
