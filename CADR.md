## $\displaystyle \mathrm{CADR=air\,flow\cdot filter \,efficiency}$
* Airflow is in cubic feet per minute
## $\displaystyle \mathrm{CADR_{\text{min}}=\frac{2}{3}}A_{\text{room}}$
* The area of the room may be measured in square feet
* E.g. a 10x10 ft room would require a CADR of 66 
## $\displaystyle \mathrm{CADR_{\text{min}}}=3V_{\text{room}}$
* The volume of the room measured in cubic meters
* E.g. a 10x10x8 ft room would require a CADR of 67
