## $X\sim \text{Uniform}(\{1,2,\ldots,m\})$
* A random variable is uniformly distributed if the probability of each $x\in S$ is equal. For the probabilities to be equal and add up to one, and since there are $m$ of $x\in S$, $p_X(x_i)=\frac{1}{m}$
* $p_X(x)=\frac{1}{m},~x\in\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$
* $F_X(x) =$ 
* $M_X(t) =$ 
* $\mathbb{E}[X]=\frac{m+1}{2}$
* $\text{var}(X) =\frac{m^{2}-1}{12}$ 
* An example of a random variable would be $X=$ the number of pips on a die face after a roll. There are 6 outcomes because $m=|\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}|=6$, meaning $p_X(x_i)=\frac{1}{m}=\frac{1}{6}$
