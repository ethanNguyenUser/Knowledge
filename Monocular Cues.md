#Biology
Monocular cues allow us to [[Sight|see]] and interpret our environment without necessarily the use of both eyes
## Main Cues
* Interposition/Occlusion
	* An object overlapping on top of another is closer
* Relative Size
	* Larger objects appear closer
* Linear Perspective
	* With converging parallel lines, objects appear further from the observer if they're closer to the convergence point
* [[Motion Parallax]]
