## $\displaystyle PV=nRT$
* $\displaystyle P$ is pressure
* $\displaystyle V$ is volume
* $\displaystyle n$ is the number of moles of the gas
* $\displaystyle R$ is the [[R]]
* $\displaystyle T$ is the temperature of the gas
## $\displaystyle PV=Nk_{B}T$
* $\displaystyle N$ is the number of particles
* $\displaystyle k_{B}$ is the [[Boltzmann Constant]]
* Can be derived by Equipartion Theorem and [[Virial Theorem]]:
