#Physics 
## $n=\frac{c}{v}$
* Index of refraction
## $\theta_r=\theta_a$
* The angle between the reflected light ray and the normal of the surface is equal to the angle between the incident light ray and the normal of the surface
## $n_a\sin(\theta_a)=n_b\sin(\theta_b)$
* Snellâ€™s Law
* $\theta$ is measured as between the light ray and the normal to the medium surfaces
* $n_a$ is the index of refraction for the medium the light enters from
* $n_b$ is the index of refraction for the medium the light enters
## $\frac{\sin(\theta_a)}{\sin(\theta_b)}=\frac{v_a}{v_b}=\frac{n_b}{n_a}$
* $\lambda=\frac{\lambda_0}{n},\space k=nk_0$
* $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light in the medium
* $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength of light in a vacuum
* $n$ is the index of refraction
* $k$ is the wave number of light in the medium
* $k_0$ is the wave number of light in the vacuum
* $f$ stays constant between mediums, $\lambda$ shortens to compensate for the wave slowing down
## $\theta_\text{crit}=\sin^{-1}(\frac{n_b}{n_a})$
* When an light ray makes an angle $\theta_\text{crit}$ with the normal of the medium surfaces, the resulting light ray travels along the seam between the mediums rather than reflecting or refracting
* $n_a$ is the medium that the light enters from
* $n_b$ is the medium that the light enters
