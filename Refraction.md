## Topics
* [[Refractive Index]]
* [[Snell's Law]]
## $\theta_\text{crit}=\sin^{-1}(\frac{n_b}{n_a})$
* When an light ray makes an angle $\theta_\text{crit}$ with the normal of the medium surfaces, the resulting light ray travels along the seam between the mediums rather than reflecting or refracting
* $n_a$ is the medium that the light enters from
* $n_b$ is the medium that the light enters
