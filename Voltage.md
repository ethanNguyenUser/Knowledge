## $\displaystyle V(\vec{r})=-\int_{\mathcal{O}}^{\vec{r}} \vec{E}\cdot  \, \mathrm{d}\vec{l}$
* Voltage at a point $\displaystyle \vec{r}$ due to an electric field $\displaystyle \vec{E}$
* $\displaystyle \mathrm{d}\vec{l}$ is any path element that leads from $\displaystyle \mathcal{O}$ to $\displaystyle \vec{r}$
* $\displaystyle \mathcal{O}$ is a reference point that is often set to infinite distance away by convention
## $\displaystyle V(b)-V(a)=-\int _{a}^{b}\vec{E}\cdot  \, \mathrm{d}\vec{l}$
* Voltage difference between points $\displaystyle a$ and $\displaystyle b$
## $\displaystyle \vec{E}=-\nabla \vec{V}$
* Negative sign is from convention
