* Essentially recommends avoiding tool-first thinking, or overoptimizing early
* Emphasize learning, which comes down to:
	* Productivity
		* Prioritizing what needs to be learned/scoping
		* Good learning requires focus
		* Priming yourself
	* Processing/encoding
		* Using higher-order learning by integrating new knowledge with past knowledge through elaborative rehearsal
		* Knowledge types
			* Factual
				* Rote memorization works fine, it's better to understand the vocab by understanding etymology for example or using mnemonics
			* Conceptual
				* Being able to link ideas, understanding what's the main idea, etc.
			* Procedural
				* Solve multiple types of problems
	* Retention
		* Where Anki comes in
		* Memory decays eventually, so you need to review every so often
			* Efficiency is improved more often by spending time properly encoding/processing the material though
