## $\displaystyle F_{\text{through }A}=\int _{A}\sigma(x,y)  \, \mathrm{d}A\approx \sum_{i\in \text{edges that intersect }A}(\sigma_{i}a_{\text{voronoi }i})(\hat{d}_{i}\cdot \hat{n})$
* This is the total axial force through a plane $\displaystyle A$ of a body defined by a mesh
* $\displaystyle \hat{d}$ is unit direction of the mesh edge
* $\displaystyle \hat{n}$ is the normal of $\displaystyle A$
* $\displaystyle a_{\text{voronoi}}$ can be approximated as $\displaystyle \frac{1}{3}$ the area of the face areas incident to the edge
