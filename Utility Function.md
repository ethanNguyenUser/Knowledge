## $\displaystyle \Delta \mathbb{E}[U_{X}]=\sum_{x = 1}^{\infty}p_{X}(x)[\ln(w+x-c)-\ln w]$
* $\displaystyle \Delta \mathbb{E}[U_{X}]$ is the change in the expected value of the utility of a random variable $\displaystyle X$
	* If greater than 0, a rational person would take this bet. Otherwise, they wouldn't
* $\displaystyle X$ is the random variable representing winnings in dollars for this particular bet without factoring cost
* $\displaystyle x$ is the winnings in dollars from the bet for a certain event
* $\displaystyle p_{X}(x)$ is the probability of winning $\displaystyle x$ dollars
* $\displaystyle w$ is the wealth of the player
* $\displaystyle c$ is the cost to play the game
## $\displaystyle \displaystyle \Delta \mathbb{E}[U_{X}]=\sum_{x = 1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^{k}}[\ln(w+2^{k}-c)-\ln w]x$
