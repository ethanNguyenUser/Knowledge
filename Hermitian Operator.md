## $\displaystyle H=H^{^{\dagger}}$
* $\displaystyle H$ is considered a hermitian operator if it satisfies the above
* $\displaystyle H^{^{\dagger}}$ is the [[Hermitian conjugate]] of $\displaystyle H$
* $\displaystyle (H^{\top})^{*}$ is the complex conjugate of the transpose of the matrix
## $\displaystyle \braket{ \Psi | H\Psi }=\braket{ H\Psi |  \Psi}$
* $\displaystyle H$ is considered a hermitian operator if it satisfies the above
* See [[Braket Notation]]
## Properties
* Eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real
* Eigenvectors of Hermitian operators are orthogonal if they have different eigenvalues
* The set of [[Eigenvector|eigenvectors]] of a Hermitian operator can be used as a basis
