## $\displaystyle H=(H^{\top})^{*}=H^{^{\dagger}}$
* $\displaystyle H$ is considered a hermitian operator if it satisfies the above
## $\displaystyle \braket{ \Psi | H\Psi }=\braket{ H\Psi |  \Psi}$
* $\displaystyle H$ is considered a hermitian operator if it satisfies the above
* See [[Braket Notation]]
## Properties
* Eigenvalues of Hermitian operators are real
* Eigenvectors of Hermitian operators are orthogonal if they have different eigenvalues
* The set of [[eigenvectors]] of a Hermitian operator can be used as a basis
