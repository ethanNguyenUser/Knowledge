A microscope that works by filtering/looking only for the light emissions from atoms that have absorbed two photons. You need a high-intensity of light to have a double absorption with two photons, so this means only the area directly in focus under say red light will be able to emit green light, and this prevents photobleaching for the region outside the area of interest.
