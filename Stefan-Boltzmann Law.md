## $\displaystyle \frac{U}{V}=\frac{\pi ^{2}}{15(\hbar c)^{3}}\tau^{4}$
* $\displaystyle U$ is the energy of the energy of a [[Blackbody Radiation|blackbody]] in 3D
* $\displaystyle V$ is the volume of the gas
* $\displaystyle \tau$ is the [[fundamental temperature]] of the blackbody
## $\displaystyle j^{\star}=\frac{U}{V}=\sigma_{B} T^{4}=s_{B}\tau^{4}$
* Check if it's the same as $\displaystyle \frac{U}{V}$
* $\displaystyle j^{\star}$ is the blackbody radiant emittance or flux density of radiant energy
* $\displaystyle \sigma_{B}$ is the [[Stefan-Boltzmann Constant]]
* $\displaystyle s_{B}$ is also the [[Stefan-Boltzmann Constant]]
* Same as intensity with units of $\displaystyle \mathrm{\frac{W}{m^{2}}}$
## $\displaystyle P=aA\sigma_{B} T^{4}$
* $\displaystyle P$ is the power of blackbody radiant emittance
* $\displaystyle A$ is the surface area of the blackbody
* $\displaystyle a$ is the graybody emissivity
