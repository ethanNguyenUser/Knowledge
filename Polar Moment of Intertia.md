## $\displaystyle J=\int_{0}^{r} \rho ^{2} \, \mathrm{d}A$
* $\displaystyle r$ is the total radius of a rod under torsion
* $\displaystyle \rho$ is a variable representing distance from axis of the rod under torsion
* $\displaystyle A$ is the area element perpendicular to the radius vector of the rod
