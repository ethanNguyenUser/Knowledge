## $\displaystyle \hat{H}\psi=E\psi$
* Time-Independent Schrodinger equation
* Obtained by [[separation of variables]]
* Derivable by [[wave equation]]
* $\displaystyle \psi(\vec{r})$ is an [[eigenfunction]]
* $\displaystyle \vec{r}$ is the [[position vector]] that is the same as $\displaystyle {\left\langle{x,y,z}\right\rangle}$ in $\displaystyle \mathbb{R}^{3}$
* $\displaystyle E$ is discrete
