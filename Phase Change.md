## $\displaystyle Q=mL$
* $\displaystyle Q$ is the heat gained or lost from the material during the phase change
* $\displaystyle m$ is the mass of the material
* $\displaystyle L$ is the heat of transformation or latent heat of the substance
## Types of Phase Change
* Solid to liquid: fusion/melting
* Liquid to solid: freezing or solidification
* Liquid to gas: boiling, evaporation, or vaporization
* Gas to liquid: condensation
* Solid to gas: sublimation
* Gas to solid: deposition
