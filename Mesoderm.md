Develops into:
1. [[Musculoskeletal System]]
2. [[Circulatory System]]
3. [[Excretory System]]
4. [[Gonads]]
5. [[Adrenal Cortex]]
## Mnemonic
* We use the mesoderm to move
	* Muscles to move
	* Circulatory system to power muscles
	* Me(i)so soup looks like pee, and we get up to move
	* Gonads: we get up to have sex
	* Adrenal cortex excrete cortisol in response to stress, so we move around
