## $\displaystyle f=\frac{{\mu}_{0}}{2\pi} \frac{I_{1}I_{2}}{d}$
* Magnitude of the force per unit length
* Direction of force is determined by the right hand rule. Current flowing parallel will result in attraction, current flowing antiparallel will result in repulsion
* $\displaystyle {\mu}_{0}$ is the [[magnetic constant]]
* $\displaystyle I_{1}$ is the current going through one of the wires
* $\displaystyle d$ is the distance between the wires
