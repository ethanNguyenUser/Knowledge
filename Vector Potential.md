Any field with 0 divergence can be written as a curl of another vector. $\displaystyle A$ is also not unique to form $\displaystyle \vec{B}$ since we could always add the gradient of some vector to it, as the curl of the gradient of a vector is 0, and curl is distributive
## $\displaystyle \nabla \times \vec{A}=\vec{B}$
* $\displaystyle \vec{A}$ is the vector potential
* $\displaystyle \vec{B}$ is the [[magnetic field]]
## $\displaystyle \vec{A}=\frac{{\mu}_{0}}{4\pi}\int \frac{\vec{J}}{\mathscr{r}} \, \mathrm{d}\tau'$
* $\displaystyle \vec{J}$ is the [[current density]]
## $\displaystyle \nabla \cdot \vec{A}=0$
* In the case of magnetostatics
## $\displaystyle \vec{A}=\frac{\vec{B}\times \vec{r}}{2}$
* For constant $\displaystyle \vec{B}$
## $\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}A=-{\mu}_{0}\vec{J}$
