A way to find extrema when constraints are applied
[Geometric Intuition](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mjcnxGMwFo)

## $$\begin{cases}
\nabla f=\lambda \nabla g \\
g=0
\end{cases}$$
* Solve this system of equations to find the extrema of $\displaystyle f$
* $\displaystyle f$ is the function we are trying to optimize for
* $\displaystyle g$ is the constraint function
* $\displaystyle \lambda$ is our lagrange
## $\displaystyle \mathcal{L}(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots ,{\lambda}_{1},{\lambda}_{2},\ldots )=f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots )-{\lambda}_{1} g_{1}(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots )-{\lambda}_{2}g_{2}(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots )-\ldots$
* $\displaystyle \mathcal{L}$ is the Lagrangian
* $\displaystyle \lambda_{i}$ is the Lagrange multiplier for the $\displaystyle i$th constraint
* $\displaystyle f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots )$ is the function of interest for when there are more than two variables
* $\displaystyle g_{i}(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots )$ is the equality constraint
