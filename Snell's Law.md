## $\displaystyle \frac{\sin \theta_{T}}{\sin \theta_{I}}=\frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}$
* $\displaystyle \theta_{T}$ is the angle between the boundary normal and the transmitted wave [[propagation vector]]
* $\displaystyle \theta_{I}$ is the angle between the boundary normal and the incident wave propagation vector
* $\displaystyle n_{1}$ is the [[refractive index]] for the medium the incident wave travels through
* $\displaystyle n_{2}$ is the refractive index for the medium the transmitted wave travels through
## $\frac{\sin(\theta_a)}{\sin(\theta_b)}=\frac{v_a}{v_b}=\frac{n_b}{n_a}$
* $\lambda=\frac{\lambda_0}{n},\space k=nk_0$
* $\lambda$ is the wavelength of light in the medium
* $\lambda_0$ is the wavelength of light in a vacuum
* $n$ is the index of refraction
* $k$ is the wave number of light in the medium
* $k_0$ is the wave number of light in the vacuum
* $f$ stays constant between mediums, $\lambda$ shortens to compensate for the wave slowing down
