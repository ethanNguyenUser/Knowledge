$\displaystyle \vec{F_{\text{s}}}=-k\vec{x}$
* $\displaystyle \vec{F_{s}}$ is the elastic force provided by a spring or elastic component on the object the spring is attached to
* $\displaystyle k$ is the spring constant of the spring
* $\displaystyle \vec{x}$ is the displacement of the object from its equilibrium position
