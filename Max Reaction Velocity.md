#Biochemistry 
The maximum rate at which all the enzymes in the reaction convert the substrate to the product form
## $\displaystyle v_{\text{max}}=k_{2}[E_{\text{tot}}]$
* $\displaystyle k_{2}$ is the reaction speed of $\displaystyle \ce{ES->E + P}$
* $\displaystyle [E_{\text{tot}}]$ is the total enzyme concentration in the reaction
