A way to figure out if two proteins are interacting. CFP (cyan fluorescent protein) and YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) may be tagged onto two separate proteins. CFP emits at the wavelength of YFP' absorption, so when CFP is near YFP, you will get less CFP emission and more YFP emission. Thus, higher ratios of YFP/CFP mean the proteins are closer together/are more likely interacting with each other.
