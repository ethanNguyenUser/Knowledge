## $\displaystyle \lVert \vec{x}\rVert_{1}=\sum_{i}\lvert x_{i}\rvert$
* A rectangular notion of distance for a vector $\displaystyle \vec{x}$
* Interestingly, for a given set of points $\displaystyle \vec{x}_{i}$, the points that minimizes the sum of euclidean distances to $\displaystyle \vec{x}_{i}$ is their [[median]]
