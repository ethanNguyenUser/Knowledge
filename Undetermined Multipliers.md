Another way to use an equation of [[holonomic]] constraint to reduce the degrees of freedom of a system rather than simply performing a substitution using the equation of constraint.  Is used to find the [[forces of constraint]]
## Notes
* Requires constraints to be expressed in terms of generalized velocities
* E.g.: $\displaystyle \sum_{i}A_{i} \dot{x_{i}}+B=0,\, i=1,2,3$
