* [[Poisson-Boltzmann Equation]]
## $\displaystyle \lambda_{D}=\sqrt{ \frac{D{\varepsilon}_{0}k_{B}T}{2z^{2}e^{2}c_{\infty}}}$
* Is the distance at which in a model of charge screening that assumes exponential decay with respect to distance from the charge object of positive/negative ion concentrations surrounding the charge object, the charge density returns back to what it is at infinity
* $\displaystyle D$ is the dielectric constant of the medium
* $\displaystyle z$ is the $\displaystyle \frac{Q}{e}$ for each ion, or the charge number of the ion
* $\displaystyle c_{\infty}$ is the concentration of the positive and negative ions at infinity relative to the charged object
* $\displaystyle e$ is the [[elementary charge]]
## $\displaystyle \lambda_{D}=\sqrt{ \frac{3D{\varepsilon}_{0}k_{B}T}{z^{2}e^{2}c_{\infty}}}$
* Assumes uniform positive/negative ion charge density with respect to distance until a sudden cutoff
