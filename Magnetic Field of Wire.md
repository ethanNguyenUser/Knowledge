## $\displaystyle B_{\text{wire}}=\frac{{\mu}_{0}I}{2\pi r}$
* The magnitude of the magnetic field $\displaystyle B_{\text{wire}}$ of an infinitely long straight wire carrying current $\displaystyle I$ measured a distance $\displaystyle r$ from the wire
* $\displaystyle {\mu}_{0}$ is the [[magnetic constant]]
* For an infinite wire
* The direction is determined by the right hand rule
## $\displaystyle B_{\text{wire}}=\frac{{\mu}_{0}I_{\text{enc}}}{4\pi s}(\sin {\theta}_{2}-\sin {\theta}_{1})\hat{\phi}$
* $\displaystyle {\theta}_{2}$ is the angle subtended between the point of observation and the end of wire that is higher in $\displaystyle z$
