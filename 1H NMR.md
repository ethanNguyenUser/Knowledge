#Chemistry 
## Integration
* The area under the curve for a signal corresponds proportionally to the number of hydrogens that emit that signal
## Peaks vs Signals
* Each group of equivalent hydrogens produce exactly one signal
* These signals can be composed of 1, 2, 3, 4, or multiple peaks. We then may say a signal is split into/has a multiplicity of a singlet, doublet, triplet, quartet, or multiplet
## Chemical Shifting
* A greater chemical shift in [[NMR]] means a lower $\displaystyle \nu$ relative to that of [[TMS]]
* Downfield (deshielded or more polar) molecules have greater chemical shift
* Upfield (shielded or more nonpolar) molecules have less chemical shift

## Signal Splitting
* $\displaystyle (n+1)$ rule
	* $\displaystyle \ce{^{1}H}$ NMR signal is split into $\displaystyle n+1$ peaks, where $\displaystyle n$ is the number of non-equivalent hydrogen neighbors
	* Only applicable if the hydrogen neighbors are the same or similar in coupling to each other
* Coupling Constant $\displaystyle (J)$
	* Describes the separation between two peaks in a signal
* [[Vicinal]] Splitting
	* Caused by hydrogens [[vicinal]] to each other
	* Follows [[Karplus Equation]]
* [[Geminal]] Splitting
	* Caused by hydrogens [[geminal]] to each other
	* Splitting is much smaller than that caused by [[vicinal]] splitting
* Benzene Protons
	* Can couple only with each other to produce multiplets
* $\displaystyle \ce{-OH}$ and $\displaystyle \ce{-NH}$ show up only as singlets
