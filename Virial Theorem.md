## $\displaystyle {\left\langle{T}\right\rangle}=-\frac{1}{2}{\left\langle{\sum_{\alpha}\vec{F}_{\alpha}\cdot \vec{r}_{\alpha}}\right\rangle}$
* $\displaystyle {\left\langle{T}\right\rangle}$ is the average kinetic energy of a system of particles in equilibrium
* $\displaystyle F_{\alpha}$ is the force on the $\displaystyle \alpha$th particle
* $\displaystyle r_{\alpha}$ is the position vector for the $\displaystyle \alpha$th particle
* RHS of equation is the Virial of the system
* Assumes a system that has come to equilibrium
