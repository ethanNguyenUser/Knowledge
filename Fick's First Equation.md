## $\displaystyle J_{x}=-D\frac{\partial C }{\partial x}$
* The flux (per unit (area * time)) in a certain direction $\displaystyle x$
* $\displaystyle D$ is the [[diffusive constant]]
* $\displaystyle C$ is concentration in the fluid
* The intuition is that if concentration is increasing rightward for instance, then flux will direct flow oppositely in a manner proportional to the diffusive constant
## $\displaystyle \vec{J}=-D\nabla C$
