## $\displaystyle [\hat{x},\hat{p}]=i\hbar$
* The operation above is a [[Commutators|commutation]]
* $\displaystyle \hat{x}$ is the [[position operator]]
* $\displaystyle \hat{p}$ is the [[momentum operator]]
## $\displaystyle [r_{i},r_{j}]=[p_{i},p_{j}]=0$
* In 3D, $\displaystyle [x,y]$ or $\displaystyle [p_{x},p_{y}]$ for example is 0 where $\displaystyle i$ and $\displaystyle j$ don't necessarily have to be the same or different
