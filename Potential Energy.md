#Physics 
Represented as either a $\displaystyle U$ os $\displaystyle V$
## $\displaystyle U_{\text{elastic}}=\frac{1}{2}kx^{2}$
## $\displaystyle U_{\text{dipole}}=\frac{kp}{r^{2}}\cos \theta$
* $\displaystyle k$ is the [[Coloumb Constant]]
* $\displaystyle p$ is the [[dipole moment]]
* $\displaystyle r$ is the distance between the point of interest and the center of the dipole
* $\displaystyle \theta$ is the angle between the dipole axis and the line from the center of the dipole to the point of interest
