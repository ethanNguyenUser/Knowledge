SDS PAGE stands for sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
Gel electrophoresis that denatures the protein at the benefit of being able to differentiate proteins based only on mass. It works by adding negative charges to the entire protein, effectively negating the effects of charge. Since it also denatures the protein, shape is no longer a factor of velocity
