#Biochemistry 
SDS PAGE stands for sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
Gel electrophoresis that denatures the protein at the benefit of being able to differentiate proteins based only on mass. It works by adding negative charges to the entire protein, effectively negating the effects of charge. Since it also denatures the protein, shape is no longer a factor of velocity.
## Required Chemicals
* Urea
	* To break hydrogen bonds
* $\displaystyle \beta$-mercaptoethanol
	* To break disulfide bonds
* Acrylamide/bisacrylamide
	* To make the gel
	* During radical chain polymerization [[polymer]] Acrylamide forms the long chains while bisacrylamide and

	* Radical initiators
* Tris-HCl
	* Used to buffer the gel
* Isopropyl alcohol
	* Used to remove bubbles from the gel
* Bromophenol blue
	* Dye used to visualize samples initially
