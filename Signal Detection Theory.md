| Signal State | Positive Detection                      | Negative Detection                |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Present      | True Positive/Hit                       | False Negative/Miss/Type II Error |
| Absent       | False Positive/False Alarm/Type I Error | True Negative                     |

## Mnemonic
* In the case of disease detection, Type I is less severe while Type II is more severe (for the individual it's better to have a false positive than it is to have a false negative)
