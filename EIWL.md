## Review
Most fun "book" I've read. This interactive guide intersperses past material into each new exercise so you don't forget the basics. I'd read and do the exercises of each chapter every other day. Obviously only really worth reading if you have access to Mathematica. 

Here's a sierpenski triangle!
```mathematica
ArrayPlot[]
