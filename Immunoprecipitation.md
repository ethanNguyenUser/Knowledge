#Biochemistry 
Isolating proteins in precipitate using [[antibodies]] and Protein A or G-coupled beads
# Steps
* Lyse cells to release antigen (POI)
* Add antibodies for POI
* Add protein A, which binds to constant region of antibodies
* Antibodies in turn bind by variable region to antigens and form a precipitate
