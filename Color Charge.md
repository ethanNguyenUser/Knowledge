* $\text{Color charge}$
	* There are 3 color charges that quarks and gluons can take: red, green, and blue
	* There are 3 color charges that antiquarks and antigluons can take: anti-red (cyan), anti-green (magenta), and anti-blue (yellow)
	* For protons/neutrons, you need a neutral overall color charge, meaning 3 or each color for each quark
	* For pions, you also need a neutral overall charge, meaning 1 quark and 1 anti quark of opposing colors
