#Biochemistry 
Conversion of pyruvate to glucose. When running in conjunction with [[glycolysis]], it is a [[futile cycle]]

## Reactions
Essentially just the reverse of [[glycolysis]], but the enzymes switched are those that use ATP for glycolysis (those shown in red above)
1. [[Pyruvate]]
	1. [[Pyruvate Carboylase]] produces [[oxaloacetate]], which is catalyzed to become [[phosphoenol pyruvate]] by
	2. [[PEPCK]]
2. [[Phosphoenol Pyruvate]]
	1. [[Enolase]]
3. [[2-Phosphoglycerate]]
	1. [[Phosphoglycerate Mutase]]
4. [[3-Phosphoglycerate]]
	1. [[Phosphoglycerate Kinase]]
5. [[1,3-Bisphosphoglycerate]]
	1. 
6. [[Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate]]
7. [[Fructose-1,6-Bisphosphate]]
8. [[Fructose-6-Phosphate]]
9. [[Glucose-6-Phosphate]]
10. [[Glucose]]
