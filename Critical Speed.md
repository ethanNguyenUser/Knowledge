Flow speeds faster than the critical speed of a fluid result in [[turbulent flow]]. Speeds slower produce [[laminar flow]]
## $\displaystyle v_{c}=\frac{N_{R}\eta}{\rho D}$
* $\displaystyle v_{c}$ is the critical speed in a tube
* $\displaystyle N_{R}$ is the [[Reynolds Number]]
* $\displaystyle \rho$ is the fluid density
* $\displaystyle D$ is the tube diameter
* $\displaystyle \eta$ is the fluid viscosity
