## $\displaystyle \tau=k_{B}T=\left( \frac{ \partial \sigma }{ \partial U } \right)^{-1}$
* Has units of energy
* $\displaystyle k_{B}$ is the [Boltzmann constant]
* $\displaystyle T$ is the temperature
* $\displaystyle \sigma$ is the [fundamental entropy]
* $\displaystyle U$ is the total energy of the system and environment
