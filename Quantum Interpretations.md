## Where is a quantum particle before it is measured?
* Realist Position
	* It is at the point of where it was measured, which is then revealed once we measure the particle
	* This was proven wrong by CHSH inequality experiments
* Orthodox Position ([[Copenhagen Interpretation]])
	* It exists as its wave function, which is then collapsed once we measure the particle
	* This has been the accepted interpretation for a while
 * Agnostic Position
	* It doesn't matter where it was because we can't possibly know
	* This was proven wrong by [[Bell's Theorem]]
* Pilot Wave
	* Postulates that the wave and particle are real and distinct
* Many Worlds Theory
* QBISM
* Consistent Histories
* Transactional Interpretation
* Stochastic Interpretation
* Quantum Darwinsim
