## Where is a quantum particle before it is measured?
1. Realist Position
	* It is at the point of where it was measured, which is then revealed once we measure the particle
	* This was proven wrong by CHSH inequality experiments
1. Orthodox Position ([[Copenhagen Interpretation]])
	* It exists as its wave function, which is then collapsed once we measure the particle
	* This is the correct answer
2. Agnostic Position
	* It doesn't matter where it was because we can't possibly know
	* This was proven wrong by Bell
