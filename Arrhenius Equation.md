## $\displaystyle k=Ae^{-\frac{E_{a}}{RT}}$
* $\displaystyle A$ is the frequency factor, or how often collisions happen
* The $\displaystyle e^{-\frac{E_{a}}{RT}}$ term indicates how likely a collision is to result in a successful reaction
* $\displaystyle E_{a}$ is the activation energy of the reaction
* $\displaystyle R$ is the ideal gas constant
* $\displaystyle T$ is the temperature of the reaction
