## $\Delta t=\gamma\Delta t_0$
* This equation describes the time dilation of an event that is stationary in $S'$ as observed by someone in the reference frame $S$
* $\Delta t$ is the time measured of an event in $S$
* $\displaystyle \gamma$ is the [[Lorentz's Factor]]
* $\Delta t_0$ is the time measured of an event that occurs at the same point in $S'$ (called the proper time for this event)
