## $A=\varepsilon lc=-\log(T)$
* $A$ is the [[absorbance]] of the light by the compound
	* Ideally [0.2-0.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer%E2%80%93Lambert_law#:~:text=The%20law%20tends%20to%20break,in%20the%20Beer%E2%80%93Lambert%20law.) for linearity
* $\varepsilon$ is the [[molar absorptivity]] and is constant only for values of $A$ between 0.1 and 1.0
* $l$ is the length the light has to pass through for the solution
* $c$ is the [[concentration]] of the solution
* $T$ is the [[transmittance]] of the light
* Only applies to dilute solutions with a constant $\displaystyle \varepsilon$
