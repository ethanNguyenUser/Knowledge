Let $a, b =$ points scored by players 1 and 2, respectively

| $a, b$ | 0    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4+                   |
| ------ | ---- | --- | --- | --- | -------------------- |
| Call   | Love | 15  | 30  | 40  | Deuce/Advantage/Game |         |

$a = b = x < 3 \rightarrow$ "$x$ - all"
$a = b \ge 3 \rightarrow$ Deuce
$a = b + 1 , ~ b \ge 3\rightarrow$ "Advantage to player 1"
$a = b + 2, ~ a \ge 4 \rightarrow$ "Game won by player 1"
## Set
Let $a, b =$ number of games won by players 1 and 2
$a \ge 6 \land a \ge b + 2 \rightarrow$ player 1 wins the set        
$a = b = 6 \rightarrow$ play tiebreaker
