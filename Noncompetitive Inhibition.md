#Biochemistry 
[[Allosteric Regulation|Allosteric inhibitor]] binds equally to the enzyme and the ES complex
![[Pasted image 20231101121531.png|400]]
* $\displaystyle K_{m}$ unaffected
	* Binding affinity of the enzyme for the substrate is unaffected, so $\displaystyle K_{m}$ is also unaffected
* $\displaystyle v_{\text{max}}$ decreased
	* Less enzyme to react, so $\displaystyle v_{\text{max}}$ decreased
