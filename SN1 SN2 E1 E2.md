Adding heat favors [[elimination]] over [[substitution]] because based on [[Gibb's Free Energy]] equation, increasing temperature will result in a more negative $\displaystyle \Delta G$ for reactions that have a higher $\displaystyle \Delta S$, and [[elimination]] increases entropy more than substitution since it produces multiple products.
