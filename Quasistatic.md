#Physics
Describes thermodynamic processes that happen slow enough such that the system maintains thermal/mechanical equilibrium. This is a necessary condition to have a definite $\displaystyle P$ or $\displaystyle T$ for a system because otherwise, different parts of the system may have different $\displaystyle P$ or $\displaystyle T$ when not at thermal/mechanical equilibrium
