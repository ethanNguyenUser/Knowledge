States that particles follow the path that minimizes their [[action]]. Historically, Hamilton's principle was postulated after Lagrangian mechanics were derived, but it may be used to define Lagrangian mechanics
## $\displaystyle \delta S[q(t)]=0$
* $\displaystyle S$ is the [[action]] of the system
* $\displaystyle q(t)$ is the [[generalized coordinates]] of the system with respect to time
* States that to find $\displaystyle q(t)$, you need to find the minimum of the action
