Historically, Hamilton's principle was postulated after Lagrangian mechanics were derived, but it may be used to define Lagrangian mechanics
## $\displaystyle \delta \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \mathcal{L}(x_{i},\dot{x}_{i}) \, \mathrm{d}t=0$
* Rectangular coordinates version
* $\displaystyle \mathcal{L}$ is the [[Lagrangian]] of the system
## $\displaystyle \delta \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}} \mathcal{L}(q_{j},\dot{q}_{j},t) \, \mathrm{d}t=0$
* Generalized version
