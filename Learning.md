## Types of Cognitive Load
* Intrinsic
	* Dependent on the material (e.g. Calculus has a higher intrinsic cognitive load than biology)
* Germane
	* Dependent on integrating content into existing knowledge schema (e.g. asking how the content relates to other fields, utilizing creativity, building as many associations between the new content and past learned content such as by linking it into a Second Brain with Obsidian)
* Extrinsic
	* Dependent on factors unrelated to the content (e.g. lecturer's hard-to-understand accent)
## Techniques
##### Priming
* Review lecture slides for at least 10 minutes before class
###### What to Think During Lecture
* How is this content relevant to me/what I already know?
* How will this content be tested/used?
* How will the lecture end/what is the overall message?
##### Active Recall
* Review the lecture content afterward (~ an hour after), doing problems or reviewing notes
