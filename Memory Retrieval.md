## Types
* Recall
	* Harder
* Recognition
	* Easier
* Relearning
	* Memory that has been learned in the past is quicker to relearn
	* Spacing Effect: the longer the time between the first and second time one learns/relearns something, the longer one can still recall that information
* Semantic Network
	* Memory works as a connection of facts rather than a serial list of them, kind of like how these notes/wikis are represented
	* Spreading Activation
		* When one node of a semantic network activates recall of another
	* Recall Cue
* Interference
	* Proactive Intereference
		* Old memories get in the way of learning of new things
	* Retroactive Interference
		* New memories overwrite old ones
		* E.g.: Teachers have a hard time remembering past students' names after learning a new batch of students' names
	* False Memories
		* Misinformation Effect
			* External information can contaminate memories
		* Intrusion errors
			* Past memories can confound new memories
