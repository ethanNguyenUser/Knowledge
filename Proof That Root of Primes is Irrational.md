Let $\displaystyle p$ be a prime number
Prove: $\displaystyle p^{1/n}\neq \frac{a}{b}~\forall~a,b\in\mathbb{R}$
Assume for contradiction that $\displaystyle  p^{1/n}=\frac{a}{b}$
$$
\begin{align}
p^{1/n}&=\frac{a}{b} \\
p&=\frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}} \\
\end{align}
$$
But $\displaystyle \frac{a^{n}}{b^{n}}$ is a rational number, and by definition of prime numbers, $\displaystyle p$ can't be represented as a fraction, so there' s a contradiction
$\displaystyle \therefore$ by [[Proof by Contradiction]], the root of a prime number must be irrational
$\displaystyle Q.E.D.$
