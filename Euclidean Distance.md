## $\displaystyle \lVert \vec{x}\rVert_{2}=\sqrt{ \sum_{i}x_{i}^{2} }$
* Interestingly, for a given set of points $\displaystyle \vec{x}_{i}$, the points that minimizes the sum of euclidean distances to $\displaystyle \vec{x}_{i}$ is their [[mean]]
## $\displaystyle d=\sqrt{ (x_{i}'-x_{i})^{2} }$
* Distance between two points
* Assuming [[Einstein notation]]
* $\displaystyle x_{i}$ refers to summing over all coordinate differences
