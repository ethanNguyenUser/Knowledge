#Biochemistry 
Describes ring carbohydrates that differ due to difference in orientation of carbonyl during hemiacetal formation. Exchange between two forms is called [[mutarotation]] and happens spontaneously
## Example
![Draw the alpha and beta forms of glucose and explain the difference between  them. | Homework.Study.com](https://homework.study.com/cimages/multimages/16/glucose7545349468638727623.png)
The carbon that originally contained the carbonyl carbon is called the [[anomeric carbon]]
