## $\displaystyle F=k \frac{qQ}{\mathscr{r}^{2}}\mathscr{\hat{r}}$
* $\displaystyle k$ is the [[Coloumb constant]]
* $\displaystyle {\varepsilon}_{0}$ is the [[Electric Constant|permittivity of free space]]
* $\displaystyle \mathscr{r}=\vec{r}-\vec{r}'$ where $\displaystyle \vec{r}$ is the is vector pointing from the origin to the test charge and $\displaystyle \vec{r}'$ is the vector pointing from the origin to the source charge. The overall vector is thus pointing from the source charge to the test charge
