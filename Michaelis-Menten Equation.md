#Biochemistry 
## $\displaystyle \ce{E + S <=>[k_{1}][k_{-1}] ES ->[k_{cat}] E + P}$
* $\displaystyle \ce{E}$ is the enzyme
* $\displaystyle \ce{S}$ is the substrate
* $\displaystyle k_{1}$ is the association rate
* $\displaystyle k_{-1}$ is the disassociation rate
* $\displaystyle k_{\text{cat}}$ is the catalysis rate

## $\displaystyle v=\frac{v_{\text{max}}[S]}{K_{\text{m}}+[S]}$
* $\displaystyle v$ is the velocity of substrate conversion
* $\displaystyle [S]$ is the concentration of substrate
* $\displaystyle K_{m}$ is the [[Michaelis constant]]
