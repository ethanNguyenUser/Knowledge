* $\displaystyle k_{-2}$ is the disassociation rate into ES from E + P

## $\displaystyle v=\frac{v_{\text{max}}[S]}{K_{\text{m}}+[S]}$
* Assumes:
	1. Second step above is rate-limiting
	2. $\displaystyle [P]\approx 0$
	3. Reaction is in [[steady state]] such that $\displaystyle [\text{ES}]$ is constant and influx of ES equals efflux
* $\displaystyle v$ is the velocity of substrate conversion commonly in units of $\displaystyle \mathrm{\frac{\mu M}{min}}$
* $\displaystyle v_{\text{max}}$ is the max velocity and is $\displaystyle k_{2}[\text{E}_{\text{tot}}]$
* $\displaystyle [S]$ is the concentration of substrate commonly in units of $\displaystyle \mathrm{mM}$
