[R]C[R]
```
* These two R groups are geminal to each other because they are two bonds apart
* If they were three bonds apart, they'd be [[vicinal]] to each other
## Mnemonic
The [Gemini Twins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)) are next to each other and generally closer together than are vicinal atoms
