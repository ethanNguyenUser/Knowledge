#Physics 
A constant describing fluid flow dependent on the geometry, surface roughness, and etc. of the environment that the fluid is flowing through
## $\displaystyle N_{R}=\frac{v_{c}\rho D}{\eta}$
* $\displaystyle v_{c}$ is the [[critical speed]] of the fluid
* $\displaystyle \rho$ is the fluid density
* $\displaystyle D$ is the tube diameter
* $\displaystyle \eta$ is the fluid viscosity
