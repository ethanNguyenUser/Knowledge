* Allows cells to move by lamellipodia ~3 Âµm/min
* ADP-actin dissociates at the pointed end (i.e. negative end), gets phosphorylated (sped up by [[profilin]]) to ATP-actin, and adds to the barbed end (positive end)
* [[Cofilin]] may break up the microfilaments to increase the number of open ends of microfilaments
