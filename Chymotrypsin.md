Enzyme that cleaves peptide bonds
## Steps
1. Binding of peptide
2. Attack carbonyl to form $\displaystyle \ce{O-}$
3. $\displaystyle \ce{O-}$ comes back down to break $\displaystyle \ce{N-C}$ bond and reforming carbonyl
4. Water added
5. Water attacks carbonyl to form $\displaystyle \ce{C-OH}$ bond
6. $\displaystyle \ce{O-}$ comes back down to break bond between serine and carbonyl carbon
7. Product released
