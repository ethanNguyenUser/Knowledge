## $\displaystyle V(\vec{r})=k\sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{r^{(n+1)}}\int (r')^{n}P_{n}(\cos \alpha)\rho (\vec{r}') \, \mathrm{d}\tau'$
* Voltage of a charge density
* $\displaystyle k$ is the [[Coloumb constant]]
* $\displaystyle r$ is the [[position vector]] magnitude
* $\displaystyle r'$ is the [[source vector]] magnitude
* $\displaystyle P_{n}$ is the [[Legendre Polynomial]]
* $\displaystyle \alpha$ is the angle between the position vector and source vector
* $\displaystyle \tau'$ is the volume element
