#Biochemistry 
Specially made antibodies for the target protein are inserted in the column to grab them. They are then later eluted out
## Types

| Ligand                       | Target          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| $\displaystyle \ce{Ni^{2+}}$ | His6-tagged POI |
| Avidin                       | Biotin          |
| Glutathione                  | GST-POI         |
| polyT                        | polyA-mRNA      |
## Parts
* Feed
	* Initial sample
* Flow-Through
	* Part of sample that flows through column
* Wash
	* Buffer that goes through the column to wash out any remaining non-specific protein
* Eluate (Elution)
	* Final purified fraction with protein of interest
